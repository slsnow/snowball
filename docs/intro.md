# Learning Linux

Welcome to Learning Linux on Snowball, a site created with the purpose of having fun while expanding technical knowledge in the world of Information Technology. 

## What this isn't

This is NOT a theory based text-book. This is not to say, that learning theory is bad, there are many other great resources of that type. Hopefully, this is more activity based, and learning by doing, but there will also be links to external resources.

## Who is this for?

- Anyone that likes having fun with computers. 
- Anyone that is interested in learning practical Linux Skills
- Anyone interested in pursuing a Career in IT.
- Anyone who has a computer, can read, and can type. 

## Why Learn Linux?

- It's fun.
    - There is a lot of free software to use and contribute to.   
    - Self-Hosting your own services is really fun.
- Educational
    - Learning about Linux is a great way to learn about how computers, networking, and internet infrastructure works. 
- Linux runs the world!
    - Nearly all the top websites in the world run on Linux.

## Commandline?

The guides here will mostly be CLI focused. Wait, isn't the CLI (command line interface) old, dead, buried, and forgotten? Who needs CLI when we have pretty graphical interfaces. Right?

Wrong! The command line is cool, powerful, and fun :smile:

The commandline permits you to be an operating system power user, automate tasks quickly, and run your own services. For the uninitiated, it will feel very clumsy, kind of like my grandma hopelessly staring at her phone. With practice, it will feel as natural as using any electronic device. 

Don't get me wrong, graphical interfaces are cool too. 

## OpenSUSE?

The activities and labs are primarily openSUSE based. SUSE is the largest independent open source company in the world. The openSUSE distribution is an RPM based distro, and is free to use. This isn't to say that other Linux distros aren't great as well.

## Why not Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a very popular distribution, and is my favorite for Desktop linux. Redhat and SUSE are two of the most popular enterprise linux providers, and we will keep our focus there.

## How to learn?

Have fun. If you are enjoying what you're trying to learn, you'll want to keep learning, and things will stick. Like anything worth learning, this will require some dedication and persistence. The great thing is, these skills can accumulate and grow much quicker than you think, just like a giant snowball.

If you're having a lot of fun with these activities, I recommend that you start self-hosting applications at your house. You'll have even more fun, and learn quickly, if you're putting these skills to the test daily.

## What if I'm not having fun?
If this isn't enjoyable for you, that's okay, it's not going to be for everyone. If this feels too much like homework and pain, I'm probably not doing it right, and you can try something else.
