# Learning Linux

Welcome to Learning Linux on Snowball, a site created with the purpose of having fun while expanding technical knowledge in the world of IT.

## Who is this for?

- Anyone interested in pursuing a Career in IT.
- Anyone who has a computer, can read, and can type. 

## Why Learn Linux?

- It's fun.
    - There is a lot of free software to use and contribute to.   
    - Self-Hosting your own services is really fun.
- Educational
    - Learning about Linux is a great way to learn about how computers, networking, and internet infrastructure works. 
- Linux runs the world!

## Why Command line?

The guides here will mostly be CLI focused. Wait, isn't the CLI (command line interface) old, dead, buried, and forgotten? Who needs CLI when we have pretty graphical interfaces. Right?

...

Wrong!

The command line is cool, powerful, and fun. With the command line, you can be an operating system power user, automate tasks, and run your own services. For the uninitiated, it will feel very clumsy, kind of like my grandma hopelessly staring at her phone. With practice, it will feel as natural as navigating any electronic device. 

Don't get me wrong, graphical interfaces are cool too. 

## How to learn?

Have fun. If you are enjoying what you're trying to learn, you'll want to keep learning, and things will stick. Like anything worth learning, this will require some dedication and persistance. The great thing is, these skills can accumalate and grow much quicker than you think, just like a giant snowball.

If you're having a lot of fun with these activites, I recommand that you start self hosting applications at your house. You'll have even more fun, and learn quickly if you're putting these skills to the test daily.

## What if I'm not having fun?
If this isn't enjoyable for you, that's okay, it's not going to be for everyone. If this feels too much like homework and pain, I'm probably not doing it right, and you can try something else.
