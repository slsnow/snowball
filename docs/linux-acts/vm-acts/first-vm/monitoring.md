Linux System Monitoring Quick Guide

Introduction to system monitoring in Linux
Discuss the importance of monitoring the performance and health of a Linux system
Explain the basic concepts and terminology of system monitoring
Introducing the top command
Introduce the top command as a tool for displaying real-time information about the processes running on a Linux system
Show how to use the top command to view and sort processes by various metrics
Analyzing and interpreting top output
Explain how to read and interpret the top output, including the meaning of each column and metric
Discuss how to use the top output to identify potential performance issues and bottlenecks on a system
Using top to manage processes
Show how to use the top command to manage processes, including renicing, killing, and scheduling processes
Discuss the potential consequences and risks of using these management features
Practice exercises
Provide a series of practice exercises for students to complete, using the top command to monitor and manage processes on a Linux system.
Encourage students to experiment and try out different variations of the top command to gain a better understanding of how it works.
Linux System Monitoring Activity Guide

Practice using the top command to view and sort processes.
Use the top command without any options to view the processes running on the system.
Use the top command with the -p option to view only a specific process or group of processes.
Use the top command with the -u option to view processes for a specific user.
Use the top command with the -o option to sort the processes by a specific metric.
Experiment with using different options and arguments with the top command.
Analyze and interpret the top output to identify potential performance issues.
Use the top command to view the processes running on the system.
Carefully read and interpret the top output to identify any potential performance issues or bottlenecks.
Consider the CPU usage, memory usage, and other metrics displayed in the top output to diagnose potential problems.
Use the ps and free commands to gather additional information and context about the processes and the system's resources.
Use the top command to manage processes on the system.
Use the top command to view the processes running on the system.
top command to renice, kill, or schedule processes on the system.

Use the renice command to change the priority of a process.
Use the kill command to terminate a process.
Use the at command to schedule a process to run at a specific time.
Be careful when using these management features, as they can potentially impact the performance and stability of the system.
Practice using the top command to monitor and manage processes on the system.
Use the top command to monitor the processes running on the system in real-time.
Use the management features of the top command to renice, kill, or schedule processes as needed.
Use the ps, free, and other commands to gather additional information and context about the processes and the system's resources.
Experiment with using different options and arguments with the top command and the other commands to gain a better understanding of how they work.
