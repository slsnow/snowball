## Why install a Virtual Machine?

There are many reasons to run a virtual machine. In this case, the activities and labs require a openSUSE OS. Even if you already had a bare metal system that boots openSUSE at your house, it's still ideal to have a VM, for snapshots, and many other reasons. You will see some of these reasons yourself throughout the activities.
