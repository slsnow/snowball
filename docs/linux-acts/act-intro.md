# Linux Activity Guides - Introduction

There are a few things you should know before starting these activities. 

## Tips and Info on the Linux Activity Guides

### Take Notes

It's best to use a note-taking application, such as Obsidian, Notion, or Evernote. It can be helpful to summarize what you learned from an activity, note any questions or topics to investigate. Feedback is appreciated as well.

### Activity Organization

Most of the activities will start with some instructions on setup, and configuration before you begin the activity. If you have any trouble will these sections, please ask for help or provide feedback.

The activities are broken into task pages, with numbered sub-tasks. The instructions for the sub-tasks include expandable help sections. 

Try to complete the activities first without using the expandable help section (as much as possible). It can be good to struggle a little bit, this will help with recollection. However, if you struggle too much, that can be frustrating as well. Please ask for help in these situations.

### Repetition

After completing an activity, it can be good to wait some time, and run through the activity again. This can help to reinforce learning, but also to gain additional insight, or even confidence.

### The Fire Hose Analogy

At first, it may seem like you're drinking from a fire hose. Or in other words, you may feel like you are receiving a lot of information, but not actually digesting any of it. The great thing about learning something, is after an initial learning curve, information will become more and more interconnected, and learning becomes easier over time.

### Don't be a Copy-Pasta Wizard

If you just copy and paste everything from the activity guide, you aren't maximizing your learning. It's better to go slow, take your time, and make sure you are understanding what is happening. If you find your self just walking through the motions, then please stop, investigate, or ask for help.

### Spaced Learning

It's better to learn a little each day, instead of trying to learn everything all at once. Recollection and focus will improve.

### Have Fun

This should be fun and not frustrating. If you're feeling frustrated, please ask for help.
