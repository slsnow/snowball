This will provide you with a command-line interface (CLI) where you can enter and run Linux commands. Use the pwd command to print your current working directory. The pwd command stands for &quot;print working directory&quot;, and it will print the full path of the directory you are currently in. For example, you might see output like this: /home/user/documents. Use the ls command to list the contents of your current directory. The ls command stands for &quot;list&quot;, and it will display the names of the files and directories in your current directory. For example, you might see output like this: file1.txt file2.txt dir1 dir2. Use the cd command to change your current directory. The cd command stands for &quot;change directory&quot;, and it allows you to move to a different directory. To use the cd command, you can type cd followed by the path to the directory you want to move to. For example, if you want to move to the dir1 directory, you can run the cd dir1 command. Use the mkdir command to create a new directory. The mkdir command stands for &quot;make directory&quot;, and it allows you to create a new directory in your current location. To use the mkdir command, you can type mkdir followed by the name of the directory you want to create. For example, if you want to create a newdir directory, you can run the mkdir newdir command. Use the touch command to create a new empty file. The touch command allows you to create a new empty file in your current directory. To use the touch command, you can type touch followed by the name of the file you want to create. For example, if you want to create a newfile.txt file, you can run the touch newfile.txt command. Use the rm command to remove a file or directory. The rm command stands for &quot;remove&quot;, and it allows you to delete a file or directory from your system. To use the rm command, you can type rm followed by the name of the file or directory you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete the newfile.txt file, you can run the rm newfile.txt command. Overall, this simple activity can help you become familiar with some of the basic Linux commands, such as pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, and rm.

This will authenticate the ssh connection and allow you to access a shell on the remote system. When the ssh connection is established, you can now run commands on the remote system as if you were logged in directly on the remote system. Additional Info: Benefits of SSH There are several benefits of using SSH over other remote access methods: Security: SSH uses strong encryption to protect the data transmitted over the network. This makes it more secure than other remote access methods, such as Telnet, which transmit data in plain text. Accessibility: SSH allows users to access a remote computer from any location with an internet connection. This is useful for remote administration and support, as well as for accessing files and applications on a remote server. Scriptability: SSH allows users to automate tasks and execute commands on a remote computer using scripts. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors when performing repetitive tasks. Tunneling: SSH allows users to tunnel other protocols, such as FTP and HTTP, through an encrypted SSH connection. This can provide additional security for sensitive data and protect against network sniffing attacks. Compatibility: SSH is supported on a wide range of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile devices. This makes it a versatile and widely-used tool for remote access. Copy and Pasting: One benefit of using SSH over some other methods, is the ability to paste text. Unlike a console, where pasting is not supported, SSH allows users to easily paste text from their local clipboard into the remote terminal. This can save time and improve productivity when working with long commands or complex text. For example, imagine you are working on a remote Linux server and need to edit a configuration file with a long list of options. With a console, you would need to type out the entire list of options manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With SSH, you can simply copy the list of options from your local machine and paste them into the remote terminal. This makes it much faster and easier to edit the configuration file. Additionally, pasting text with SSH is secure, as the text is encrypted during transmission.

SSH keys consist of a pair of files: a private key, which is kept on the client machine, and a public key, which is stored on the server. SSH keys offer several advantages over other authentication methods, such as passwords. SSH keys are more secure than passwords, because they use a form of encryption that is difficult to crack. SSH keys are also more convenient than passwords, because they allow the user to authenticate without having to enter a password. danger Using the above method, would overwrite a systems existing authorized_keys files.
