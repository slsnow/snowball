To test a connection to the router, you could run: ping 192.168.0.1  Additional Notes: Router and External Networking Example Output: # ip route default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.101 The default gateway is for any and all traffic which is not destined for the local network and for which no preferred route is specified in the route table. Traditionally, the default gateway is a dedicated network router. Router: A network device that forwards communication (data packets), from one computer network, to other computer networks. Firewall: A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic. After it filters through the traffic, it is able to allow or block communication based on a defined set of security rules. There are also software firewalls, that can run locally as well. WAN: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer networks that extend over large geographical areas. The internet, is an example of a Wide Area Network.
