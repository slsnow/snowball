Some arguments are prefixed with a - or -- characters. The specific arguments, their order, and their usage can vary depending on the command being used. Run the following commands to see some examples of argument usage. Example A​ cat --help  Here, the --help argument specifies that the cat command should show its help information, rather than performing its normal operation. Example B​ cat /etc/os-release  This command displays the contents of a file to a terminal (among other uses). The /etc/os-release argument specifies the name of the file that the cat command should display. Example C​ cat -n /etc/os-release  This command displays the contents of the /etc/os-release file to the terminal, with line numbers added to each line. Example D​ cat -n -E /etc/os-release  The -n and -E arguments specify that the cat command should add line numbers, and a $ character to the end of each line, respectively.

They provide detailed information about the usage and options for a particular command, as well as examples and descriptions of its functionality. To access man pages, you can use the &quot;man&quot; command followed by the name of the command you want to learn about. For example: man cat  The &quot;man cat&quot; command displays the man page for the &quot;cat&quot; command. man -k copy | grep -i files  This command would search the manual pages for the keywords &quot;copy&quot;, and additionally &quot;files&quot; (more on piping and grep later). This is useful for finding commands that might be relevant to a particular task. tip Google is your friend as well if you want to quickly find a man page or a command for a specific task.

"},{"title":"3 - Tab Completion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux Commands","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/1vm/commands#3---tab-completion","content":"Linux tab completion is a feature that allows you to type a partial command and then press the tab key to automatically complete the command. This can save time and make it easier to run commands, especially if you're not sure of the exact syntax. To use tab completion in Linux, simply type the first few letters of a command, then press the tab key. If there is only one possible completion for the command, it will automatically be completed for you. If there are multiple possible completions, you can press the tab key again to see a list of options. Tab Completion Activity​ Type the following command and press the tab key: ls -l /va  The terminal will automatically complete the command to ls -l /var This will show the possible arguments, in this case directories within the /var/ directory. Press tab key twice Now type in the following, and use tab completion to complete to the file /var/log/YaST2/y2start.log, and hit enter. Use tab completion, and double tabbing, to complete the following commands: ip address show eth0  cat /etc/zypp/repos.d/openSUSE-Leap-15.4-1.repo  zypper lp --with-optional --severity critical  caution Notice that the last argument &quot;critical&quot; did not have an autocompletion result. In this case, you'd have to already know the argument, or search the man page. tip There are several advantages to using tab completion including: Saving timeReducing the risk of errorsHelps you learn new commandsMakes it easier to run commands "},{"title":"4 - Tricks​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux Commands","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/1vm/commands#4---tricks","content":"Use $(command) to run a command and insert its output into another command. For example, you could use echo &quot;Today is $(date)&quot; to display the current date and time. Use | (the &quot;pipe&quot; symbol) to redirect the output of one command to another command. For example, you could use ls -l | less to display the output of the ls command in the less pager, which allows you to scroll through the output more easily. Use echo $? to display the exit status of the last command you ran. A exit status of 0 usually indicates that the command ran successfully, while a non-zero exit status indicates an error. Combining these tricks, you can do very powerful things, like this: Long Example​ for i in $(rpm -qa --last | head -n 10 | sort -h | awk '{print $1}'); do printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$i &quot;; rpm -V $i; if [ $? -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; [ -z &quot;$(rpm -V $i)&quot; ]; then printf &quot;No Discrepencies\\n&quot;; else echo $?; fi; done  Here is a breakdown of the steps performed by the for loop in the given command: The rpm -qa --last command is run to list the installed packages on the system, sorted by the time they were last installed.The head -n 10 command is used to limit the output to the first 10 packages in the list.The sort -h command is used to sort the packages in human-readable format (e.g. &quot;1&quot; comes before &quot;10&quot;).The awk '{print $1}' command is used to extract the first column of the output, which contains the names of the packages.The output from the previous steps is passed to the for loop as a list of package names, and the loop is run once for each package in the list.For each iteration of the loop, the printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$i &quot; command is used to print the name of the package, followed by a space character.The rpm -V command is run for the current package, to verify its integrity.The if statement is used to check the exit status and output of the rpm -V command. If the exit status is 0 and the output is empty, the printf &quot;No Discrepencies\\n&quot; command is run to print &quot;No Discrepencies&quot; on the same line as the output from the previous steps.If the exit status is not 0 or the output is not empty, the echo $? command is run to print the exit status of the rpm -V command.The for loop continues to run for each package in the list, until all packages have been processed. In summary, this for loop runs the rpm -V command for the last 10 installed packages on the system, and checks the exit status and output of the command to determine if there are any discrepancies in the packages. If there are no discrepancies, it prints &quot;No Discrepencies&quot; on the same line as the name of the package. If there are discrepancies, it prints any output and the exit status of the rpm -V command. This can be useful for detecting and troubleshooting problems with installed packages.

By using them, you can quickly move around the command line, edit and delete text, and access your command history without having to use the mouse or other input devices. Note that these keyboard shortcuts may vary depending on the configuration of your system and the settings of your bash shell. Some of the shortcuts may not work, or may have different functions, depending on your specific setup. It's always a good idea to consult the documentation for your system and your bash shell to learn about the available keyboard shortcuts and how to use them. "},{"title":"6 - PATH and HASH​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux Commands","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/1vm/commands#6---path-and-hash","content":"In Linux, the bash shell uses the PATH and hash variables to find and run commands. The PATH variable is a list of directories that bash searches when you run a command. When you type a command in bash, it looks for the command in each of the directories listed in the PATH variable, in the order they are listed, until it finds the command or reaches the end of the list. This allows you to run commands without specifying the full path to the command. For example, if the PATH variable is set to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin, bash will search for the command in the /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, and /bin directories, in that order, until it finds the command or reaches the end of the list. The hash variable is used by bash to keep track of the locations of commands that have been run recently. When you run a command in bash, it stores the location of the command in the hash table. This allows bash to quickly find and run the command the next time you run it, without having to search through the directories in the PATH variable. For example, if you run the ls command in bash, it will store the location of the ls command in the hash table.

These commands can be useful when you want to find out where a particular command is located on your system, or when you want to determine if a command is built-in to the shell or provided by an external command. The which command searches through the directories listed in the PATH variable to find the location of a command. For example, if you want to find the location of the ls command, you can use the following which command: Copy code which ls This command will search the directories in the PATH variable for a file named ls, and will print the full path to the file if it is found. For example, the which command might print /usr/bin/ls to indicate that the ls command is located in the /usr/bin directory. The type command is similar to the which command, but it also checks for built-in shell commands and shell functions. For example, if you want to find out if the cd command is a built-in shell command or a separate command, you can use the following type command: Copy code type cd This command will check if the cd command is a built-in shell command, a shell function, or an external command, and will print the appropriate output. For example, the type command might print cd is a shell builtin to indicate that the cd command is built-in to the shell.

This can be useful for creating short, easy-to-remember commands that represent more complex or frequently used commands. For example, you could create an alias named ll that runs the ls -l command, which shows the contents of a directory in a long format that includes file permissions and other details. To create an alias, you can use the alias command followed by the name of the alias and the command that you want it to run. For example, to create an alias named ll that runs the ls -l command, you would use the following command: Copy code alias ll='ls -l' Once you have created an alias, you can use it just like any other command. For example, to use the ll alias that you created in the previous example, you would simply type ll at the command prompt and press enter. The ls -l command that the alias represents would then be run. Aliases are not permanent, so if you close the terminal or log out and log back in, the aliases that you created will no longer be available. To make an alias permanent, you can add it to your shell's configuration file. The location and name of this file will vary depending on the shell that you are using, but it is typically called .bashrc for the Bash shell or .zshrc for the Zsh shell. You can add your alias to this file by opening it in a text editor and adding a line that defines the alias, using the same format as the alias command. For example, to add the ll alias that you created earlier to your .bashrc file, you would add the following line: Copy code alias ll='ls -l' After you save the changes to your configuration file and open a new terminal, the alias that you created will be available to use.

The ./ argument specifies the current directory, so ls -la ./ will list the contents of the current directory in long format, including hidden files and directories. $ ls -la ./ total 40 drwxrwxr-x 5 user user 4096 Dec 6 12:37 . drwxrwxr-x 4 user user 4096 Dec 6 12:30 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 12 Dec 6 12:37 .hiddenfile.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1234 Dec 6 12:34 file1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 2345 Dec 5 12:35 file2.pdf -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 3456 Dec 4 12:36 file3.docx drwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Dec 3 12:37 directory1 drwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Dec 2 12:38 directory2  Finally, ls -la /var/log/messages will list the contents of the /var/log/messages directory in long format, including hidden files and directories. This directory typically contains log files for the system. $ ls -la /var/log/messages total 40 drwxrwxr-x 5 user user 4096 Dec 6 12:37 . drwxrwxr-x 4 user user 4096 Dec 6 12:30 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 12 Dec 6 12:37 .hiddenfile.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1234 Dec 6 12:34 file1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 2345 Dec 5 12  current and parent directories​ In Linux and other operating systems, the ./ and ../ symbols are used to specify the current directory and the parent directory, respectively. These symbols can be used in file and directory paths to make them more compact and easier to read. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, and you want to specify the file1.txt file in that directory, you could use a relative path like ./file1.txt. The ./ at the beginning of the path indicates the current directory, so this path is equivalent to the full, absolute path /home/user/documents/file1.txt. Similarly, if you want to specify the documents directory itself, you could use a relative path like ../documents. The ../ at the beginning of the path indicates the parent directory, so this path is equivalent to the full, absolute path /home/user/documents. Using these symbols can be useful when you need to specify a file or directory path that is relative to the current working directory, rather than using the full, absolute path. It can also make your commands more readable and easier to understand. For example, instead of typing out the full, absolute path for a file, you can use a relative path with ./ or ../ to specify its location in relation to the current working directory. "},{"title":"cd command​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux CLI System Navigation","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/1vm/navigation#cd-command","content":"Introduce the cd command for changing directories The cd command is used to change the current working directory in Linux and other operating systems. This command allows you to navigate the file system and access different directories. To use the cd command, you simply type cd followed by the path of the directory you want to change to. For example, if you want to change to the /home/user/documents directory, you would use the following command: Copy code $ cd /home/user/documents After running this command, the current working directory will be changed to /home/user/documents. You can verify this by running the pwd command, which will print the current working directory: Copy code $ pwd /home/user/documents In addition to absolute paths, you can also use relative paths with the cd command. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, you can use the ../ symbol to change to the parent directory like this: Copy code $ cd .. $ pwd /home/user You can also use the cd command without any arguments to change to your home directory. For example: Copy code $ cd $ pwd /home/user Overall, the cd command is an essential tool for navigating the file system and accessing different directories on your system. It is often used in combination with other commands, such as ls and pwd, to help you efficiently manage your files and directories. "},{"title":"","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux CLI System Navigation","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/1vm/navigation##","content":"Wildcards are special characters that can be used to represent one or more characters in a file or directory name. In Linux and other operating systems, the most commonly used wildcards are *, ?, and [ ]. The wildcard represents zero or more characters. For example, the pattern .txt would match any file that has a .txt extension, regardless of the filename. $ ls *.txt file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  The ? wildcard represents a single character. For example, the pattern file?.txt would match any file that has a .txt extension and is exactly four characters long, with the fourth character being any single character. $ ls file?.txt file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  The [ ] wildcard represents a range or set of characters. For example, the pattern file[123].txt would match any file that has a .txt extension and is exactly eight characters long, with the fifth, sixth, and seventh characters being either 1, 2, or 3. $ ls file[123].txt file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  Wildcards can be used with many commands, not just ls. For example, you could use the mv command to move multiple files that match a certain pattern, like this: $ mv *.txt backup/  This command would move all files with a .txt extension to the backup directory. Overall, wildcards are a powerful tool for working with files and directories in Linux. They allow you to quickly and easily match and manipulate groups of files, without having to specify each one individually. Introduce the mkdir command for creating directories Introduce the rmdir command for removing directories Introduce the mv command for moving and renaming files and directories Practice exercises Provide a series of practice exercises for students to complete, using the commands introduced in the previous sections. Encourage students to experiment and try out different variations of the commands to gain a better understanding of how they work.

Additional Info: Benefits of SSH There are several benefits of using SSH over other remote access methods: Security: SSH uses strong encryption to protect the data transmitted over the network. This makes it more secure than other remote access methods, such as Telnet, which transmit data in plain text. Accessibility: SSH allows users to access a remote computer from any location with an internet connection. This is useful for remote administration and support, as well as for accessing files and applications on a remote server. Scriptability: SSH allows users to automate tasks and execute commands on a remote computer using scripts. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors when performing repetitive tasks. Tunneling: SSH allows users to tunnel other protocols, such as FTP and HTTP, through an encrypted SSH connection. This can provide additional security for sensitive data and protect against network sniffing attacks. Compatibility: SSH is supported on a wide range of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile devices. This makes it a versatile and widely-used tool for remote access. Copy and Pasting: One benefit of using SSH over some other methods, is the ability to paste text. Unlike a console, where pasting is not supported, SSH allows users to easily paste text from their local clipboard into the remote terminal. This can save time and improve productivity when working with long commands or complex text. For example, imagine you are working on a remote Linux server and need to edit a configuration file with a long list of options. With a console, you would need to type out the entire list of options manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With SSH, you can simply copy the list of options from your local machine and paste them into the remote terminal. This makes it much faster and easier to edit the configuration file. Additionally, pasting text with SSH is secure, as the text is encrypted during transmission.

This command terminates the SSH session and closes the connection to the remote server. exit  tip Usually, if you disconnect from a remote SSH session, while a command or process is running, it will continue to run, as it is being executed on the remote system.

For this activity, we will be leaving them at their defaults, but you should be aware of these files. Additional Info: SSH Configuration Client Side Configuration Files: ssh_config This file is used by the SSH client, and contains settings that apply to all SSH connections made from the client machine. This can specify the default SSH port, the default user to connect as, and other security options. For more info see man ssh_config. known_hosts This file is used by the SSH client to store the public keys of servers that the client has previously connected to. The known_hosts file is typically located in the ~/.ssh directory on the client machine. Server Side Configuration Files: sshd_config This file is used by the SSH server, and contains settings that apply to the SSH server and control how it operates and manages SSH connections. It can specify which users are allowed to connect to the server, the authentication and encryption methods to allow, the server's listening port, among other things. For more info, see man sshd_config. authorized_keys This file is used by the SSH server to store the public keys of users who are allowed to connect to the server.

A - Generate an SSH Key Pair​ Make sure you have exited out of your remote system vm1-snowball, and you're on your local machine in gitbash. Run the following command: ssh-keygen  When prompted, just hit the enter key several times, using the default settings, until finished (this only needs to be done once). B - Copy the Key to the Remote System​ Similar to Step 2 above, run the following: ssh-copy-id USER@IP_ADDRESS  Then insert the password when prompted. For example: ssh-copy-id root@192.168.0.101  This will copy the key to the remote system, allowing passwordless logins. C - Test another Login​ Test logging in like in Step 2 above. If successful, you can now SSH into the system without the use of a password. Additional Info: SSH Keys SSH keys are a type of cryptographic key that is used for authentication in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SSH keys consist of a pair of files: a private key, which is kept on the client machine, and a public key, which is stored on the server. SSH keys offer several advantages over other authentication methods, such as passwords. SSH keys are more secure than passwords, because they use a form of encryption that is difficult to crack. SSH keys are also more convenient than passwords, because they allow the user to authenticate without having to enter a password.
