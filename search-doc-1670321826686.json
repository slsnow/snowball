Example Aâ€‹ cat --help  Here, the --help argument specifies that the cat command should show its help information, rather than performing its normal operation. Example Bâ€‹ cat /etc/os-release  This command displays the contents of a file to a terminal (among other uses). The /etc/os-release argument specifies the name of the file that the cat command should display. Example Câ€‹ cat -n /etc/os-release  This command displays the contents of the /etc/os-release file to the terminal, with line numbers added to each line. Example Dâ€‹ cat -n -E /etc/os-release  The -n and -E arguments specify that the cat command should add line numbers, and a $ character to the end of each line, respectively.

For example: man cat  The &quot;man cat&quot; command displays the man page for the &quot;cat&quot; command. man -k copy | grep -i files  This command would search the manual pages for the keywords &quot;copy&quot;, and additionally &quot;files&quot; (more on piping and grep later). This is useful for finding commands that might be relevant to a particular task. tip Google is your friend as well if you want to quickly find a man page or a command for a specific task.

"},{"title":"3 - Tab Completionâ€‹","type":1,"pageTitle":"Linux Commands","url":"/snowball/docs/linux-acts/vm-acts/first-vm/commands#3---tab-completion","content":"Linux tab completion is a feature that allows you to type a partial command and then press the tab key to automatically complete the command. This can save time and make it easier to run commands, especially if you're not sure of the exact syntax. To use tab completion in Linux, simply type the first few letters of a command, then press the tab key. If there is only one possible completion for the command, it will automatically be completed for you. If there are multiple possible completions, you can press the tab key again to see a list of options. Tab Completion Activityâ€‹ Type the following command and press the tab key: ls -l /va  The terminal will automatically complete the command to ls -l /var This will show the possible arguments, in this case directories within the /var/ directory. Press tab key twice Now type in the following, and use tab completion to complete to the file /var/log/YaST2/y2start.log, and hit enter. Use tab completion, and double tabbing, to complete the following commands: ip address show eth0  cat /etc/zypp/repos.d/openSUSE-Leap-15.4-1.repo  zypper lp --with-optional --severity critical  caution Notice that the last argument &quot;critical&quot; did not have an autocompletion result.

For example, you could use echo &quot;Today is $(date)&quot; to display the current date and time. Use | (the &quot;pipe&quot; symbol) to redirect the output of one command to another command. For example, you could use ls -l | less to display the output of the ls command in the less pager, which allows you to scroll through the output more easily. Use echo $? to display the exit status of the last command you ran. A exit status of 0 usually indicates that the command ran successfully, while a non-zero exit status indicates an error. Combining these tricks, you can do very powerful things, like this: Long Exampleâ€‹ for i in $(rpm -qa --last | head -n 10 | sort -h | awk '{print $1}'); do printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$i &quot;; rpm -V $i; if [ $? -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; [ -z &quot;$(rpm -V $i)&quot; ]; then printf &quot;No Discrepencies\\n&quot;; else echo $?; fi; done  Here is a breakdown of the steps performed by the for loop in the given command: The rpm -qa --last command is run to list the installed packages on the system, sorted by the time they were last installed.The head -n 10 command is used to limit the output to the first 10 packages in the list.The sort -h command is used to sort the packages in human-readable format (e.g. &quot;1&quot; comes before &quot;10&quot;).The awk '{print $1}' command is used to extract the first column of the output, which contains the names of the packages.The output from the previous steps is passed to the for loop as a list of package names, and the loop is run once for each package in the list.For each iteration of the loop, the printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$i &quot; command is used to print the name of the package, followed by a space character.The rpm -V command is run for the current package, to verify its integrity.The if statement is used to check the exit status and output of the rpm -V command. If the exit status is 0 and the output is empty, the printf &quot;No Discrepencies\\n&quot; command is run to print &quot;No Discrepencies&quot; on the same line as the output from the previous steps.If the exit status is not 0 or the output is not empty, the echo $? command is run to print the exit status of the rpm -V command.The for loop continues to run for each package in the list, until all packages have been processed. In summary, this for loop runs the rpm -V command for the last 10 installed packages on the system, and checks the exit status and output of the command to determine if there are any discrepancies in the packages. If there are no discrepancies, it prints &quot;No Discrepencies&quot; on the same line as the name of the package. If there are discrepancies, it prints any output and the exit status of the rpm -V command. This can be useful for detecting and troubleshooting problems with installed packages.

When you type a command in bash, it looks for the command in each of the directories listed in the PATH variable, in the order they are listed, until it finds the command or reaches the end of the list. This allows you to run commands without specifying the full path to the command. For example, if the PATH variable is set to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin, bash will search for the command in the /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, and /bin directories, in that order, until it finds the command or reaches the end of the list. The hash variable is used by bash to keep track of the locations of commands that have been run recently. When you run a command in bash, it stores the location of the command in the hash table. This allows bash to quickly find and run the command the next time you run it, without having to search through the directories in the PATH variable.

These commands can be useful when you want to find out where a particular command is located on your system, or when you want to determine if a command is built-in to the shell or provided by an external command. The which command searches through the directories listed in the PATH variable to find the location of a command. For example, if you want to find the location of the ls command, you can use the following which command: Copy code which ls This command will search the directories in the PATH variable for a file named ls, and will print the full path to the file if it is found. For example, the which command might print /usr/bin/ls to indicate that the ls command is located in the /usr/bin directory. The type command is similar to the which command, but it also checks for built-in shell commands and shell functions. For example, if you want to find out if the cd command is a built-in shell command or a separate command, you can use the following type command: Copy code type cd This command will check if the cd command is a built-in shell command, a shell function, or an external command, and will print the appropriate output. For example, the type command might print cd is a shell builtin to indicate that the cd command is built-in to the shell.

This can be useful for creating short, easy-to-remember commands that represent more complex or frequently used commands. For example, you could create an alias named ll that runs the ls -l command, which shows the contents of a directory in a long format that includes file permissions and other details. To create an alias, you can use the alias command followed by the name of the alias and the command that you want it to run. For example, to create an alias named ll that runs the ls -l command, you would use the following command: Copy code alias ll='ls -l' Once you have created an alias, you can use it just like any other command. For example, to use the ll alias that you created in the previous example, you would simply type ll at the command prompt and press enter. The ls -l command that the alias represents would then be run. Aliases are not permanent, so if you close the terminal or log out and log back in, the aliases that you created will no longer be available. To make an alias permanent, you can add it to your shell's configuration file. The location and name of this file will vary depending on the shell that you are using, but it is typically called .bashrc for the Bash shell or .zshrc for the Zsh shell. You can add your alias to this file by opening it in a text editor and adding a line that defines the alias, using the same format as the alias command. For example, to add the ll alias that you created earlier to your .bashrc file, you would add the following line: Copy code alias ll='ls -l' After you save the changes to your configuration file and open a new terminal, the alias that you created will be available to use.

These symbols can be used in file and directory paths to make them more compact and easier to read. For example, if the current working directory is /home/user/documents, and you want to specify the file1.txt file in that directory, you could use a relative path like ./file1.txt. The ./ at the beginning of the path indicates the current directory, so this path is equivalent to the full, absolute path /home/user/documents/file1.txt. Similarly, if you want to specify the documents directory itself, you could use a relative path like ../documents. The ../ at the beginning of the path indicates the parent directory, so this path is equivalent to the full, absolute path /home/user/documents. Using these symbols can be useful when you need to specify a file or directory path that is relative to the current working directory, rather than using the full, absolute path. It can also make your commands more readable and easier to understand.

Additional Info: Windows SSH Clients PuTTY is a popular SSH client for Windows, but there are several other SSH clients that are available for Windows, and that offer similar or better functionality than PuTTY. Some of the best alternatives to PuTTY include: MobaXterm: MobaXterm is a feature-rich SSH client for Windows that includes many advanced features, such as a built-in X11 server, a built-in SFTP client, and support for multi-tabbed sessions. MobaXterm also includes a range of tools for remote administration, such as a terminal emulator, a remote desktop client, and a network scanner. KiTTY: KiTTY is a fork of PuTTY that adds several new features and improvements, such as session saving and reopening, automatic logon, and support for graphical applications (e.g. X11 forwarding). KiTTY is a lightweight and easy-to-use SSH client, and is a good alternative to PuTTY for users who want a more feature-rich SSH client. SecureCRT: SecureCRT is a commercial SSH client for Windows that offers advanced features and a user-friendly interface. SecureCRT includes support for multiple protocols (e.g. SSH, Telnet, Rlogin), support for multiple session types (e.g. VT100, VT102, VT220), and support for a wide range of authentication methods (e.g. public key, password, keyboard-interactive).

This will authenticate the ssh connection and allow you to access a shell on the remote system. When the ssh connection is established, you can now run commands on the remote system as if you were logged in directly on the remote system. Additional Info: Benefits of SSH There are several benefits of using SSH over other remote access methods: Security: SSH uses strong encryption to protect the data transmitted over the network. This makes it more secure than other remote access methods, such as Telnet, which transmit data in plain text. Accessibility: SSH allows users to access a remote computer from any location with an internet connection. This is useful for remote administration and support, as well as for accessing files and applications on a remote server. Scriptability: SSH allows users to automate tasks and execute commands on a remote computer using scripts. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors when performing repetitive tasks. Tunneling: SSH allows users to tunnel other protocols, such as FTP and HTTP, through an encrypted SSH connection. This can provide additional security for sensitive data and protect against network sniffing attacks. Compatibility: SSH is supported on a wide range of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile devices. This makes it a versatile and widely-used tool for remote access. Copy and Pasting: One benefit of using SSH over some other methods, is the ability to paste text. Unlike a console, where pasting is not supported, SSH allows users to easily paste text from their local clipboard into the remote terminal. This can save time and improve productivity when working with long commands or complex text. For example, imagine you are working on a remote Linux server and need to edit a configuration file with a long list of options. With a console, you would need to type out the entire list of options manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. With SSH, you can simply copy the list of options from your local machine and paste them into the remote terminal. This makes it much faster and easier to edit the configuration file. Additionally, pasting text with SSH is secure, as the text is encrypted during transmission.

Additional Info: SSH Keys SSH keys are a type of cryptographic key that is used for authentication in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SSH keys consist of a pair of files: a private key, which is kept on the client machine, and a public key, which is stored on the server. SSH keys offer several advantages over other authentication methods, such as passwords. SSH keys are more secure than passwords, because they use a form of encryption that is difficult to crack. SSH keys are also more convenient than passwords, because they allow the user to authenticate without having to enter a password. danger Using the above method, would overwrite a system's existing &quot;authorized_keys&quot; file. In a normal scenario, you might not want to do that. This was just used for a quick example.

In progress... Computer Networking: Computers are more useful when they can communicate with other computers. Computer networking is the process by which computers are able to communicate with each other. A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area, such as your home network. Network Adapter: A Network Adapter is a component that connects a computer system to a computer network, and is also called a Network Interface Controller (NIC), among other names. Media Access Control Address: A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a NIC. Switch: A device that connects devices on a computer network, and passes communication (packet switching) between the devices. Network Bridge: A network bridge is a virtual switch that funnels the virtual guests through to the physical NIC of the VM host machine. DHCP more details 1: lo: ... This section refers to the loopback interface, or Local Host.This is an interface, that assigns the localhost IP 127.0.0.1, which will loop back to the system itself.The loopback address is useful for debugging tasks.For more information: Leap 15.4 Networking Docs 2: eth0:... This is the default device name assigned to the NIC. For now, we won't worry about the rest of the values on that line. link/ether 08:00:27:74:5f:18 ...

This section refers to the ipv6 address. The default gateway is for any and all traffic which is not destined for the local network and for which no preferred route is specified in the route table. Traditionally, the default gateway is a dedicated network router. Router: A network device that forwards communication (data packets), from one computer network, to other computer networks. Firewall: A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic. After it filters through the traffic, it is able to allow or block communication based on a defined set of security rules. There are also software firewalls, that can run locally as well. WAN: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer networks that extend over large geographical areas. The internet, is an example of a Wide Area Network.
